# BVC-Tech-Skills-Industry-Project
Phase 2 of Bow Valley College Calgary Election Project.

This is the second phase of the industry project completed as part of the Tech Skills Initiative at Bow Valley College. 

I developed a public-facing user dashboard in MS Power BI, building on an extensive SQL database of municipal demographic data prepared as a group project. Its purpose is to enable potential Calgary municipal election candidates to easily analyse demographic and voting data in order to make more informed campaigning choices. The final dashboard was uploaded live in July 2021.
